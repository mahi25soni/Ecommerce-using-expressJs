# E-commerce-using-django
An E-commerce website using Django with features of seller and buyer. It have all features like cart, checkout, history of the buyer/seller, and paypal payment integration has also been added. I'll add more feature to it because it's good but not enough.

See every website focus on the buyer side, we also have developed everthing related to buyer, 
but the feature that make this website a stand out is it’s seller feature. A seller can choose image, write price, description, and name of the product, and he can also see everything he has posted on the site, and can remove if he wants to.

The buyer will see the products posted by different sellers. Then this site have list of function to do	 :-

-	Add to cart – This will add items to your cart, and the number of items that your cart have can be seen over the cart icon in navigation bar.
-	Cart page – This page will have the entire list of your items, you can increase or decrease number of items of a product. Or you can directly remove the product you don’t want. The price per product, per item, total price are all calculated and shown here. After assuring your cart you can move you checkout page.
-	Checkout page – This is where you will enter your shipping address, and you will pay using the paypal payment integration.
-	Profile page – When you click on the name of user in navigation bar, it will show you the profile of user (both buyer/seller can see that). Where seller can see the products they have posted till date. Buyer can see the product that have bought till today with date/time. There is a logout button in the profile page itself.


## Functions I am looking to add on in future
- Search bar
- Change Password
- Reset Password (Through Email)
- Getting the details of a product, when you click on it
- Reviews and Ratings
